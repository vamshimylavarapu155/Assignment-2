Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to fullname function that should return the (full name). o For example: ▪ First_name = “your first name”, last_name = “your last name” ▪ Full_name = “your full name” o Write function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string. Str = “Good evening” Output: Go vnn Note: You need to create a function named “string_alternative” for this program and call it from main function.
It is a Python program that takes user input for first name and last name, then uses a function to generate the full name and finally applies the string_alternative function to get every other character in the full name. This program defines two functions (fullname and string_alternative) and a main function. The main function takes user input for first and last names, generates the full name using the fullname function, and then prints the result of applying string_alternative to the full name.

Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output. o Finally store the output in output.txt file. Example: Input: a file includes two lines: Python Course Deep Learning Course Output: Python Course Deep Learning Course Word_Count: Python: 1 Course: 2 Deep: 1 Learning: 1
It is a Python program that reads a file named input.txt, counts the occurrences of each word on each line, prints the output, and stores it in an output.txt file. This program defines a count_words function to count the occurrences of each word in a given line. The main function reads each line from the input file, prints the line, counts the words, prints the word count for each line, and writes the output to the output.txt file.

Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
Nested Interactive loop.
List comprehensions Example: L1: [150,155, 145, 148] Output: [68.03, 70.3, 65.77, 67.13]
This is a Python program that reads heights in inches from the user, converts them to centimeters using both nested interactive loop and list comprehensions, and stores the results in separate lists. This program defines two functions, convert_to_cm_nested and convert_to_cm_list_comprehension, to convert heights from inches to centimeters using a nested interactive loop and list comprehensions, respectively. The main function takes user input for the number of customers and their heights, then prints the converted heights using both methods.
